These are scripts to make data pull requests and data analysis faster and easier. I created a bunch of functions that include: - convert data from SAS to R-friendly format  - import data from old and new databases - combine old and new databases into a single data frame - get crash flags (i.e. deer, teen driver)

These scripts make data pull requests and data analysis faster and easier. I created a bunch of functions that include:
- convert data from SAS to R-friendly format (FST)
- import data from old and new databases
- combine old and new databases into a single data frame
- get crash flags (i.e. deer, teen driver)
- bin by age group and crash time
